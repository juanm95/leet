[23. Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/description/) Solved. 2 minutes over.

[380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/description/) After 20 minutes couldn't solve. I was missing a specific trick, popping from the end of an array by swapping items. I wouldn't call this one hard, but I should look at the the sequel (scheduled it) to see if I do any better. Reminds me a little of "Different Number" where you can do swaps to sort an array.

[209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/description/) Solved in about 15. Left a couple of bugs in my code though. Didn't think about what I needed to return if I didn't find the solution, had some variable name issues.

[46. Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/description/) Solved in about 20. Straight forward backtracking. Had to remember the paradigm of pushing and popping. I used a set to track what I hadn't seen yet in the path, but really I wasn't using any properties of the set in my algo, so I could have just used an array and iterated through that.

[40. Combination Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/description/) Solved in 14. Still backtracking. I thought I could do sliding window, but nothing in the problem said the answers should be subarrays. In order to avoid dups I sorted and then backtracked while skipping previous entries. I also had to check if the current element was the same as the last before backtracking.
