# Study Process

1. Work on problem for 30 minutes. Write stuff out. Be verbose.
1. If I'm almost there, just finish, otherwise move on.
1. Look at solution.
1. Reflect on the solution. Record what insights were needed and what I was missing. Record datastructures, algorithms, run times, tricks.
1. If my solution was buggy, record them in a list of mistakes.
1. Fix up my solution to at least the most optimal run time.
1. Copy-paste this code into this repo. Link my reflections to this code.
1. Do this 6 times. For the 2 hardest, do them again in 2 weeks.

## Potential changes.
1. When working on a problem, maybe just try coding up the brute force and try to improve on it, take a more iterative approach.
1. Schedule in solving a problem I couldn't solve 2 weeks later as review.

## Underlying Concepts
1. Why is this data structure or approach the best one for this problem?
1. Have I done any other problem that's similar to this one, if so why are they similar? Is there a way I can leverage that similarity? How can I recognize this in the future?
1. What problems are similar that I haven't solved yet? Schedule em.
